# WHY
- PURELY FOR LEARNING: i am under no such delusions that these are even close to the most optimal solutions used by the actual GNU coreutils; it's my first time touching go so im just learning about packages and basics.

# TO IMPL
- [x] `ls`: file handling, cli args
- [x] `cat`: basic i/o, streams
- [x] `wc`: parsing, strings
- [ ] `grep`: flag and regexp
- [ ] `sed`: like recursive ls, pretty formatting
- [ ] `curl`: http
- [ ] `tree`: like recursive ls, pretty formatting

# MAYBE
- [ ] `awk`
- [ ] `nc`
